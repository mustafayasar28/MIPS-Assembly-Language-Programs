This program gets an input from the user and creates an array with the size of input given. Every element of the array is a random integer generated by the program between 1 and 100000. After creating the array, the program sorts the array using bubblesort algorithm, and checks every element if they are prime integers or not. And prints the array. 

One thing that should be explained is that while checking if an integer is prime or not, the program takes the square root of the integer. After taking the square root, it starts to divide the integer by every integer between 2 and the square root. This method is incredibly efficient compared to the method that checks until the half of the integer. That way, operation is much faster, thus, much more efficient.
